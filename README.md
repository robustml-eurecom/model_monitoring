# Model Monitoring and Dynamic Model Selection in Travel Time-series Forecasting

This repository contains the code and the useful links to reproduce the experiments in the paper [Model Monitoring and Dynamic Model Selection in Travel Time-series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07268).

The M4 competition dataset, together with the monitored models used in the framework, are available in the original [M4 repository](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M4-methods).

The implementation of the two meta-learning approaches used for the comparison with our approach can be found in the following links:
